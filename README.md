<!-- Overview -->
## Overview

During my time at McKinsey & Coompany, I deilvered value through improvements and added funcitonality in existing McKinsey codebases. This document is a broad overview of my contributions to the firm's services without revealing any propietary information. 

Because of the sensitive nature of the Firm's codebases and the restrictions placed on us being Firm members, I will avoid using any code snippets and rely just on explanation.

I'd like to thank Multiverse for their continued support throughout my apprenticeship process. They have truly paved the way into a new career for me
and I will be forever grateful. 

Of course, I would like to thank McKinsey & Co. for employing me and giving me such a great learning environment to hone my skills. 
I can already see a durastic change in my skills and value to the team and it is all because of their great team organization and learning community. 

A special thanks to my Coach at multiverse, Linda, for her tireless support of me and the other apprentices in my cohort. I hope you continue
to help other engineers start their careers!
